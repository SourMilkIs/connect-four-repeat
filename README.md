DESCRIPTION:
This project creates a textual Connect Four gameboard (6x7) for two players. 

Players take turns dropping their character pieces into a column, and the first player with four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) becomes the winner. A round ends with a player's victory, surrender, or draw: after which, players have the option to contine (by starting another round) or end the game. 

The welcome process ensures that players understand the instructions and allows them to share their pronouns and pick their characters (◔◡◔ or ಠ_ಠ). Players have the option to swap characters with their corresponding pronouns and scores tracked.

INSTALLATION:
